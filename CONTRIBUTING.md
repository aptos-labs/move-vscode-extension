# Contributing to Move on Aptos Extension

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our extension! There are number of ways to contribute.

## Leave a feedback 

The most desirable way to contribute right now is to report a bug or propose a new feature in the Github Issues.

## On opening a pull request

At this point the extension is very actively developed, and there's a significant code churn. So, to avoid your PR being stale, 
or not accepted because of the priorities - open an issue to discuss it before doing any real work.
